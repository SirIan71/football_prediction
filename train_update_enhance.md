# Football Prediction Model Analysis

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 73.24%, a significant improvement over random guessing (33.33% for a 3-class problem).
- **F1-Scores**:

  - **Home Wins**: 79%
  - **Away Wins**: 75%
  - **Draws**: 58%

  The model performs best on home wins, followed by away wins, and struggles most with draws.

## Confusion Matrix (Image 1)

- **Home Wins**: Predicted most accurately (1433 correct out of 1732).
- **Away Wins**: Predicted well (927 correct out of 1223).
- **Draws**: Most challenging to predict (540 correct out of 1012).

  There's some confusion between draws and both home/away wins, which is expected given the nature of football matches.

## Feature Importance (Image 2)

- **xG Difference**: By far the most important feature, directly related to the expected goal difference.
- **Head-to-Head Statistics**: Home win rate, away win rate, and draw rate are the next most important features.
- **Away xG and Home Form**: Also contribute significantly.

## Learning Curve (Image 3)

- **Overfitting**: The model shows signs of slight overfitting, with the training score consistently higher than the cross-validation score.
- **Score Plateau**: The cross-validation score plateaus around 72-73%, suggesting that adding more data might not significantly improve performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Create more complex features or interactions between existing features, especially those related to xG and head-to-head statistics.

2. **Handling Draws**:

   - The model struggles most with predicting draws. Explore techniques such as adjusting class weights or using more sophisticated ensemble techniques to address this.

3. **Regularization**:

   - Increase regularization in your models, especially for RandomForest and GradientBoosting, to address slight overfitting.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:

   - Consider using a focused GridSearchCV around the best parameters found for each model to fine-tune performance.

5. **Model Interpretability**:

   - Given the importance of xG difference, explore more interpretable models (like decision trees) for insights into how this feature influences predictions.

6. **Data Quality**:

   - Ensure the quality and recency of your data, especially for xG calculations and head-to-head statistics, as these are the most important features.

7. **Time-based Validation**:
   - Use time-based cross-validation to ensure your model performs well on the most recent matches.

## Conclusion

Your model shows good performance, especially considering the inherent unpredictability of football matches. The focus on xG and head-to-head statistics is a strong approach. With fine-tuning, particularly in handling draws and reducing overfitting, there is potential to further improve the model.
