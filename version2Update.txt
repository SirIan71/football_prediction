Model Training:

All three models (RandomForest, XGBoost, and GradientBoosting) were successfully tuned.
The previously tuned SVC model was loaded without issues.


Feature Importance:

For all three models, 'goal_ratio' and 'h2h_away_win_rate' are the most important features.
This consistency across models suggests these features are indeed very predictive.


Ensemble Model Performance:

Accuracy: 0.9652 (96.52%) on the test set, which is excellent.


Classification Report:

Precision, recall, and F1-score are very high for all classes (away_win, draw, home_win).
The model seems to perform slightly better on home_win predictions.


Cross-validation Scores:

Mean CV score: 0.9461 (94.61%)
The cross-validation scores are consistent, indicating the model is stable across different subsets of the data.


Score Prediction:

Home Goals Prediction MAE: 0.0859
Away Goals Prediction MAE: 0.1706
These low Mean Absolute Error values suggest the score predictions are quite accurate.
