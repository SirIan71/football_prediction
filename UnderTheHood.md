# Under The Hood

## Our Ensemble Model

Our ensemble model combines multiple machine learning algorithms to make predictions. Based on the code we developed earlier, here's a breakdown of what our ensemble model is doing "under the hood":

### Model Components

Our ensemble consists of four different models:

- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

### Voting Mechanism

We're using a "soft" voting method. This means:

- Each model in the ensemble predicts probabilities for each class (home win, away win, draw).
- These probabilities are averaged across all models.
- The class with the highest average probability is chosen as the final prediction.

### Feature Processing

Before the data reaches the individual models, it goes through a pipeline that includes:

- **Imputation**: Filling in missing values using the mean of the column.
- **Scaling**: Standardizing the features so they're on the same scale.
- **Feature Selection**: Using a Random Forest to select the most important features.

### Key Features

The model considers various factors for each match, including:

- Team strengths (offensive and defensive)
- Expected goals (xG) for home and away teams
- Head-to-head statistics
- Recent form of both teams

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Each model in the ensemble was tuned using RandomizedSearchCV, which means:

- Multiple combinations of hyperparameters were tested for each model.
- The best performing set of hyperparameters was chosen for each model.

### Prediction Process

When a new prediction is requested:

- The input data (selected teams) is processed through the same pipeline used during training.
- Each model in the ensemble makes its own prediction.
- The predictions are combined using the soft voting method.
- The final prediction and associated probabilities are returned.

### Handling Different Leagues

The model can handle teams from different leagues because:

- It was trained on data from multiple leagues.
- Team strengths and other features are normalized, making cross-league comparisons possible.

### Continuous Learning

While the current model doesn't update itself automatically, the design allows for periodic retraining with new data to keep the predictions up-to-date.

This ensemble approach leverages the strengths of different algorithms:

- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** are good at handling non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
- **Gradient Boosting** is effective at reducing bias and variance.
- **SVM** can be effective in high-dimensional spaces and works well when classes are separable.

By combining these models, we aim to create a more robust and accurate predictor that can handle the complexities and uncertainties inherent in football match outcomes.
